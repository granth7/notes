### Goal
Deploy a custom app to get and cache secrets from a cloud secrets manager (I use Bitwarden Secrets Manager, it has a free tier). I use external-secrets together with [bws-cache](https://github.com/rippleFCL/bws-cache) to cache and handle secrets needed by other apps in my cluster. Checkout that project's readme to learn more about how it works. 
### Prerequisite
[Talos Kubernetes - Post Install Details (Split DNS)](../../posts/post-install-details)
### Instructions
1. Clone [my repo](https://github.com/granth7/talos-flux-cluster) and navigate to `/kubernetes/apps` in a file explorer or terminal.
2. Copy the `external-secrets` folder into your project's `/apps` directory.
3. Navigate to `/apps/external-secrets/external-secrets/bitwarden-secrets-manager`.
4. Delete the file `secret.sops.yaml`:
`rm secret.sops.yaml`.
5. We are going to create and encrypt our own. Create a new file `secret.sops.yaml` with 
`touch secret.sops.yaml`
6. Type in or paste in the following:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: bws-secret
stringData:
    token:
    ORG_ID: 
```
**Important:** Do **NOT** commit this file unless you have **verified it has been successfully encrypted** by running `sops --encrypt --in-place secret.sops.yaml` in the following steps.  First we need to setup Bitwarden to get our secret access token (token) and organization id (ORG_ID).
6. Create and setup a Bitwarden organization if you need one by following the instructions in Bitwarden's [Organizations Quick Start](https://bitwarden.com/help/getting-started-organizations/) (It's free).
7. Create a project and give it a name that identifies it with your cluster.
8. Enable the Secrets Manager. There should be a free option.
9. From within your organization, go to Machine Accounts and create a new access token. Copy the token and paste it into the `token:` parameter within `secret.sops.yaml`.
10. Create a secret and assign it to the project you created. Name it `Test_secret` and put whatever you want as the value. We'll retrieve this value at the end to verify everything works.
11. You can get your BWS organization ID two ways:

- From BWS CLI:
    - `bws project list` / `bws project get <project_id>` - Your organization ID is shown in the `organizationId` value of each project returned.
    - `bws secret list` / `bws secret get <secret_id>` - Your organization ID is shown in the `organizationId` value of each secret returned.
- From browser:
    1. Go to [https://vault.bitwarden.com](https://vault.bitwarden.com/)
    2. Open Secrets Manager from the apps list in the top right
    3. Your organization ID is in the URL like this: `https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/sm/<BWS org ID>`
Copy and paste the organization id after the ORG_ID: parameter within `secret.sops.yaml`.
11. Save the file, and then from the same directory run:
`sops --encrypt --in-place secret.sops.yaml` and then save it again. Now when you click on `secret.sops.yaml` in VS Code it should open the decrypted .gitignored file in the editor named `.decrypted-secret.sops.yaml` (Note: You may need to install the vscode-sops extension into the dev container if this isn't working). If you select `secret.sops.yaml` again, you should see that it has been encrypted by sops. **Important: Make sure secret.sops.yaml is encrypted before committing.**
12. Commit your changes when you're ready and wait for flux to deploy everything. Be patient, it may be a few minutes before everything is ready. Check the status with:
`task kubernetes:resources`. The ingress host `bws-cache.${SECRET.DOMAIN}` should be assigned to the internal ingress VIP address shortly.
13. Once everything is ready, check that the secret has been pulled in from Bitwarden with:
`kubectl get secret test-secret -n external-secrets -o jsonpath='{.data.data}' | base64 --decode`.
The plaintext value you set in step 10 should be printed.
### Tips
It can be helpful to manually reset the cache when you want a secret to be updated. 

1. First, update the secret's value in the Bitwarden Secrets Manager.
2. Then, expose the service so we can curl the `/reset` endpoint. This can be done by port-forwarding the `bws-cache` service like so:
`kubectl port-forward service/bws-cache -n external-secrets  5000:5000`
 3. In another terminal, run:
`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <BWS token>" http://localhost:5000/reset`.
4. Rerun `kubectl get secret test-secret -n external-secrets -o jsonpath='{.data.data}' | base64 --decode`.
5. The updated value should be printed in the terminal output. 

### Next
Use this secrets caching mechanism to [deploy metrics, logging, and alerts](../../posts/deploy-metrics-logging-alerts) to monitor cluster health, metrics, and logs.
