### About
Cluster resources with internal addresses are routed via the internal nginx service, and likewise external addresses are routed via the external nginx service. 
Applications with their [ingress class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class) set to `internal` will only be accessible to devices within the cluster,
whereas those with an `external` ingress class will be publicly available to anyone on the internet.

But what about when devices on your private network need to access an 'internal' resource, without being a part of the cluster?
A common example would be accessing [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard metrics running internally at `grafana.my.domain` from your workstation.  
This is exactly what Split DNS can accomplish.

### Prerequisites
[Initial Machine Setup for Talos Flux Cluster](../../posts/initial-machine-setup)
### Instructions
We will configure split DNS as mentioned in the [post install instructions in github](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template?tab=readme-ov-file#-flux-w-cloudflare-post-installation). 
To accomplish this in OPNsense, follow these steps:


1. Go to Services > Unbound DNS > Query Forwarding
2. Add new (select the '+' button)
3. Ensure the box labeled 'Enabled' is checked.
4. Enter your domain in the form of 'my.doamin'. This should be the same value used during cluster config under `bootstrap_cloudflare.domain` in `config.yaml`.
5. For IP address, use the IP of the `k8s_gateway` set in the cluster config. This is found under `bootstrap_cloudflare.gateway_vip` in `config.yaml`.
6. Optionally enter a description. I put 'Split DNS' to remind me why the rule is in place.
7. Leave Port blank.
8. Click save and then apply your changes. You may need to restart the Unbound DNS service.
9. To test, run `dig gateway_vip hubble.your.domain`, replacing gateway_vip with its associated value. If it returns the value of `bootstrap_cloudflare.ingress` then your internal nginx should assign an internal ip to `hubble.your.domain`. Check with `kubectl get ingresses -A`. You should see something like this:
```
NAMESPACE    NAME        CLASS      HOSTS                      ADDRESS       PORTS  AGE
...
kube-system  hubble-ui   internal   hubble.your.domain         192.168.1.20  80     1d
```

### Next steps
Check out [Talos Kubernetes - Add External Secrets](../../posts/add-external-secrets) to allow apps to securely pull secrets (api keys, tokens, etc.) with the added benefit of a cache to manage the pulls.
