### About
After an interface is created, we need to assign it so that we can reference it with a more descriptive name, e.g. 'HOMELAB' instead of 'opt1'. The descriptive name is helpful for things like creating firewall rules since you don't have to remember the identifier.

### Prerequisite
If you haven't created the new interface yet, see [Add New VLAN interface](../../posts/add-new-vlan-interface) and follow the instructions there first.

### Instructions
In Interfaces > Assignments, under 'Assign a new interface', select the VLAN you created from the dropdown menu in the column next to 'Device', e.g. re0_vlan902.
Give it a description to name it. Pick something that easily identifies the purpose of the VLAN, e.g. HOMELAB.
Select Add, then select Save.
