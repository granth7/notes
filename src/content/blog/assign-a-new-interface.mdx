### About
After an interface is created, we need to assign it to a description so that OPNsense can reference the interface with the description provided. The descriptive name is helpful when creating firewall rules for example, since you don't have to remember the identifier.

### Prerequisite
If you haven't created the new interface yet, see [Add New VLAN interface](../../posts/add-new-vlan-interface) and follow the instructions there first.

### Instructions
In Interfaces > Assignments, under 'Assign a new interface', select the VLAN you created from the dropdown menu in the column next to 'Device', e.g. re0_vlan902.
Give it a description to name it. Pick something that easily identifies the purpose of the VLAN, e.g. HOMELAB.
Select Add, then select Save.
