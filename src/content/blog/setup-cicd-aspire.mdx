### Prerequisite
Read through [Helm Releaser and .NET Aspire Intro](../../posts/deploy-aspire-app)

### Goal
Use my [sample application](https://github.com/granth7/etymo/tree/546e21e440e6295820908c53df2dfd735abe21c7) as a reference for configuring CI/CD with your .NET Aspire app.

### Tech Stack Overview

- (Optional) TailwindCSS - CSS Framework
- (Optional) DaisyUI - Component library for Tailwind
- (Optional) Redis for caching
- (Optional) .NET Aspire Admin dashboard for metrics, tracing
- .NET - integrate C# code inline with HTML/CSS for responsive rendering, C# code behind for core logic
- .NET api service
- .NET Aspire - AppHost handles api service to website communication, service defaults (telemetry, tracing, health checks, service discovery), and testing.
- [Aspir8](https://prom3theu5.github.io/aspirational-manifests/getting-started.html) - Used to generate manifests for deploying to Kubernetes
- Github Actions - Continuous integration/Continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows:
	- CI: Restore -> Build -> Test -> Generate Helm Chart -> Push -> Create Pull Request
	- CD: Release helm chart and publish GitHub Release 
- Talos Flux Cluster - Kubernetes cluster running on bare-metal Talos Linux machines
- Renovate - Automatically creates pull requests diffs provided by flux when installed apps are updated. 

### Instructions
- Build out the .NET Aspire demo app you created previously until it meets your requirements.
- Optionally enable the redis cache and admin dashboard.
- Make sure GitHub actions has appropriate read and write permissions. Go to your repo > Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions > Check 'Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests' > Save.
- Copy the structure of the build and release files in the sample application's [workflows](https://github.com/granth7/etymo/tree/546e21e440e6295820908c53df2dfd735abe21c7/.github/workflows) directory.
- Here's how those workflows work:

### CI/CD Flow
`aspire-build.yml`:
- New feature commit is pushed to main branch.
- Github actions runs CI workflow: Project is built, tested, helm manifests generated, and then a pull request is made on a new build release branch.
- Pull request is reviewed manually and merged if approved. Build branch is deleted.

`chart-release.yaml`:
- CD workflow runs and publishes the helm chart on github pages in the github-pages branch. The new build is released as a GitHub release.
- After CI/CD completes, Renovate will run on schedule and pick up the newest release if there is one. Renovate then creates a pull request showing the flux local diff for the new version.
- Once manually reviewed and approved, the existing helm release is automatically upgraded in Kubernetes and the application can be accessed externally as soon as the new resources become available. 

### Install app in Kubernetes
- In your Talos repo, navigate to kubernetes > flux > repositories
- Create a HelmRepository resource containing the url of the helm chart hosted on github pages:
```
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: <reponame>
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 2h
  url: https://<github-username>.github.io/<reponame>
```
- In the same directory, edit `kustomization.yaml` and add the path to the new HelmRepository resource:
```
  - ./<reponame>.yaml
```
- Go to kubernetes > apps > default and add a folder for your app which contains the HelmRelease and kustomization files needed. See [here](https://github.com/granth7/talos-flux-cluster/tree/0b028b66e38670904be9a8e6d27cd251d7e2f46e/kubernetes/apps/default/etymo) for an example.
- Set the chart version to the version you wish to deploy.
- (Optional) Override chart values if necessary. If you want to expose the app publicly, set ingress to external and provide the appropriate host and externalUrl.
- Commit changes. The application should be deployed by flux! You should now have a complete ci/cd pipeline. Approved merges to your application should automatically create a new release, which will be picked up by Renovate on schedule.
- Renovate creates a pull request diff whenever a new release is published, or by triggering Renovate manually.
