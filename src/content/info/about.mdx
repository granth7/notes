# Hello world! ðŸŒŽ

  

I'm Grant, a software engineer and homelab hobbyist. This site is a collection of notes I compiled to document my homelab setup.

The notes cover how to configure your own custom router, setup VLANs on your switch, and self-host Kubernetes across multiple machines that you own.
All the articles are specific to my setup, so they won't apply to every hardware/os iteration.
My goal is to provide a baseline for getting started self-hosting with your own hardware.


Please refer to the linked references in each article for more detailed information.
If you would like to suggest a change or want to post an article that belongs here, please [create a pull request](https://github.com/granth7/notes/pulls) with references to the information included.
